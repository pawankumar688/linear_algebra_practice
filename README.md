# Practice Linear Algebra:

## Topic we are going to cover:

### 1) Dot Product
### 2) Scaler Multiplication
### 3) Projection
### 4) Transpose
### 5) Determinant of metrics
### 6) Inverse
### 7) Row echlone method
### 8) Inverse method
### 9) Eigen Vectore

## Purpose Of Doing This:
It is simple, Math is one of the complicated subject for the beginners who want to become ML Engineer or Data Scientist, but when some come across to the math they just lose the drive to become one, for them it is hard and I'm not a exception too, It is hard for me too, but I can't just give up on my dream, so after the learning the basics of math which will be used in Machine Lerning or Deep Learning, It's also important how it is looks in code form, so I doing exactly same thing, it's just for practice and understanding the basics of math which will be one of the base layer of " House Of My Dreams ", (sounds clishe right?) I know, so for that I doning best to understand everything about the basics and will proceed to the next stage, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
